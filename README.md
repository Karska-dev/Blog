>brew services start mongodb-community@4.4

To stop a mongod running as a macOS service, use the following command as needed:

>brew services stop mongodb-community@4.4

To run MongoDB (i.e. the mongod process) manually as a background process, issue the following:

To stop a mongod running as a background process, connect to the mongod from the mongo shell, and issue the shutdown command as needed.
